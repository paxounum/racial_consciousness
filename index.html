          Placing our Race Consciousness
        </h2>
        <p>
          Where does our understanding of race come from? Yes—who, what—but
          really: where?
          <em
            >I wonder if we can geographically place the experiences that have
            formed our understanding of race.</em
          >
          An understanding I believe to be a social construct which deeply
          informs perceptions of ourselves and our perceptions and interactions
          with others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>I think that we can.</em> And, I think if we take the time to map
          these experiences, our deepened spatial awareness might just tell us a
          little more about the tangents of racial consciousness. Race is a
          complex narrative which we have been given, one which we also
          participate in co-creating—for ourselves and others. &quot;Place&quot;
          is one character in this narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I'd love to sit down with you and talk about this over coffee, a
          napkin and pen in hand, unfortunately we can't do that right now. So,
          instead, I want to walk you through a few concepts so we are talking
          in the same terms before we delve into some deeper questions. This
          will be a little bit of reading before we get into your writing. Grab
          some tea and let's get comfy.

          <p class="help-block">
            I invite you to reflect on the arc of your racial narrative in space
            and time through three points (or three collections of points):
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Focal Point:</strong> This is the place which clarified your
            prototype for what race would mean for you. Perhaps this is where
            you learned to normalize whiteness, where you were raised into
            utopic &#x27;race blindness,&#x27; or something more radical. This
            is the place that set your early norms around racial and/or ethnic
            identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pivot Point:</strong> This is the place where you started to
            question the harmful norms you had been given. It can also be the
            place where you solidified the helpful norms you had been given.
            This is the place you had &quot;that experience&quot; which opened
            your eyes to difference, to privilege, to Power, to supremacy, to
            division. This might be a vulnerable place, where your knowledges,
            your behaviors, or even a particular relationship was
            challenged—where the familiar (your Focal Point) was brought into
            question.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Point of Return:</strong>
            This is a place or set of places which remain touchstones in your
            developing racial consciousness, towards anti-racial deconstruction
            and/or progressive multiracial community development. This place may
            be one of your own, one personally experienced (a new community, a
            healing trip, a sacred space), or this may be a place given to you
            by authors you have read (i.e. Baldwin&#x27;s Chicago or Paris, bell
            hooks&#x27; Berea or Appalachia, Winona LaDuke&#x27;s White Earth
            Reservation or Standing Rock Camp). This is the place you visit to
            find refreshment, refinement, and/or a call to action towards racial
            reconciliation. This place reminds you that change is (continually)
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will guide you through a few questions surrounding these ideas.
            Now, I know these terms are new, but I hope they might also feel
            familiar. I&#x27;m asking you to go on a bit of a journey with me
            and to narrate as much as necessary.

            I will be collecting these stories and digitizing them onto an
            online map. This collection process is part of a technical learning
            process for me: how to technically make maps, and how to critically
            ask questions about identity and place. But, I hope that this
            process is also helpful for you. That said, I do intend to share
            these stories at the very least with my classmates, and at the most
            to the &quot;public.&quot; I will ask you below your preferred
            audience, but please keep this in mind with what you share and be
            creative with renaming yourself or others, if necessary. However, I
            do intend to keep the geographic locations integral to the answers.

            As for your personal storytelling, I hope that my questions can be cohesive yet
            open-ended, allowing you to answer as you would like, while
            responding to the idea of the particular &quot;point&quot; in
            question. When in doubt - say what YOU would like, not what you
            think I need to document. :)

            Unfortunately, this form will only
            allow one place point for each answer, however, you are welcome to
            fill in the form, or parts of the form as much as you would like, if
            you find you have other POINTS to place on the map.
